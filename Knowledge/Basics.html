            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
            web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within
            a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
            tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
            understanding of HTML and its functions.
