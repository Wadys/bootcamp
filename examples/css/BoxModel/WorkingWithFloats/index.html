        <!-- Float Left Example -->
        <section class="container clearfix">
            <h2>Float Left Example</h2>
            <div class="box float-left">Float Left 1</div>
            <div class="box float-left">Float Left 2</div>
            <p>
            Explanation: Elements with <strong>float: left</strong> will align to
            the left side of the container. The next floated element will float next
            to it, as long as there’s enough space. These elements will sit inline
            until they fill the container width.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Clearfix Example -->
        <section class="container clearfix">
            <h2>Clearfix to Clear Floats</h2>
            <div class="box float-left">Float Left</div>
            <div class="box float-left">Float Left</div>
            <p>
            Explanation: When using floated elements, the parent container may
            collapse if it's not cleared. By applying a clearfix (as used here), the
            container expands to wrap around its floated children. This keeps the
            layout intact.

        <!-- Float Right Example -->
        <!-- 
        The float property allows an element to move to the left or right of its container, allowing other content to flow around it. When an element is floated, it is removed from the normal document flow, which means its parent container no longer recognizes its height. This causes the parent to "collapse" as if the floated element doesn't exist. To prevent this, techniques like clearfix are used to clear floats and ensure the parent container wraps around the floated child elements, maintaining the layout's integrity.
        -->

        <section class="container clearfix">
            <h2>Float Right Example</h2>
            <div class="box float-right">Float Right 1</div>
            <div class="box float-right">Float Right 2</div>
            <p>
            Explanation: Elements with <strong>float: right</strong> will align to
            the right side of the container. Just like float left, multiple floated
            elements will line up next to each other but start from the right.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Float None Example -->
        <section class="container clearfix">
            <h2>No Float Example</h2>
            <div class="box float-none">No Float</div>
            <p>
            Explanation: Elements with <strong>float: none</strong> (default value)
            stay in the normal document flow. They don’t float and maintain the
            regular layout positioning, stacking as block-level elements.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Float Left and Float Right Together -->
        <section class="container clearfix">
            <h2>Float Left and Right Together</h2>
            <div class="box float-left">Float Left</div>
            <div class="box float-right">Float Right</div>
            <p>
            Explanation: You can combine both <strong>float: left</strong> and
            <strong>float: right</strong> in the same container. The left-floated
            element aligns to the left, and the right-floated element aligns to the
            right, leaving space in between if possible.
