<!-- 
Instructions:
1. Use the provided HTML structure which includes a div element with a class of 
responsive-box.
2. Write all your CSS in the style.css file.
3. Define media queries to adjust the background color of the div based on the 
following viewport conditions:
-Mobile Devices: For screens narrower than 480px, set the background color to 
light blue.
-Tablets in Portrait Mode: For screens between 481px and 1024px with portrait
orientation, set the background color to light green.
-Tablets in Landscape Mode: For screens between 481px and 1024px with landscape
orientation, set the background color to light pink.
-Desktops and Larger Screens: For screens wider than 1025px, set the background 
color to light gray.

Due to the nature of media queries and responsive design, visual confirmation 
is the primary method for testing this exercise. Students should manually resize 
their browser windows to see the background color of the .responsive-box change
according to the different viewport conditions specified.

Note for Students:
This exercise does not lend itself to automated testing due to its reliance on 
visual checks and dynamic browser behavior. You are encouraged to actively test
the responsiveness by resizing your browser to verify that the appropriate 
styles are applied under each condition specified in the media queries.

Learning Objective:
Learn to apply media queries to adjust styles based on different viewport 
conditions, such as screen widths and orientations. Students will define CSS 
rules within specific media queries to demonstrat -->
