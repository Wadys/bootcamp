<!--
Instructions:
1. Use the provided HTML structure which includes several div elements, each 
assigned unique classes and IDs to explore different CSS concepts.
2. Write all exercise-specific styles in the style.css file.
3. Use the basic.css file for general styling, which should not be modified for
exercise evaluation purposes.
4. Perform the following tasks:
TODO 1: Demonstrate Source Order
-Apply two different colors to elements with the class .source-order. Ensure 
that the color applied later in the stylesheet is displayed.
TODO 2: Demonstrate Specificity
-Style a paragraph with class .specificity and ID #specificity-example using 
element, class, and ID selectors to show how specificity impacts style application.
TODO 3: Using the !important Flag
-Style elements with class .important-flag with two colors, using !important on
one to ensure it overrides the other.
TODO 4: Combined Cascade Algorithm
-Show how source order, specificity, and !important interact by applying conflicting
styles to elements with class .cascade-example and ID #cascade-example.

Important Note on Testing: 
Due to the nature of this exercise, which involves visually confirming the effects 
of CSS properties like specificity, source order, and the !important flag, automated 
testing is not feasible. These CSS concepts require manual inspection to ensure that
they are applied and interact as expected. You should visually check each part of the 
exercise to verify the correct application of styles. This approach will help you
develop a practical understanding of how CSS rules are interpreted and applied by
browsers, which is crucial for effective web design and development.

Learning objective:
Learn and demonstrate the effects of source order, specificity, !important, and the
CSS cascade algorithm on style application. -->
