-Use HTML entities to display at least two reserved characters (i.e, less-than, greater-than).
-Include symbols like the copyright or registered trademark using both entities and direct symbols.
3. Unordered Lists
-Create an unordered list with at least three items.
-Ensure that the items listed do not require a specific order.
