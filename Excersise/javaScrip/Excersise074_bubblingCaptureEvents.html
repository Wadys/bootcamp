Instructions
1. Event Handlers Setup:
-Attach two sets of event listeners to both the parentDiv and the childButton:
 -Bubbling Phase: Set event listeners for the bubbling phase (the third argument
 in addEventListener is false or omitted). In these handlers:
  -Log "Parent Div clicked!" when parentDiv is clicked.
  -Log "Button clicked!" when childButton is clicked. Additionally, call
  event.stopPropagation() in the childButton's bubbling phase handler to prevent 
  the event from bubbling up to the parentDiv.
 -Capturing Phase: Set event listeners for the capturing phase (the third argument
 in addEventListener is true). In these handlers:
  -Log "Parent Div clicked during capture!" when parentDiv is clicked.
  -Log "Button clicked during capture!" when childButton is clicked.
2. Expected Behaviors:
-On childButton Click:
 -The console should log "Button clicked!" and "Button clicked during capture!" due
to the direct click event handlers attached to the childButton.
 -The console should also log "Parent Div clicked during capture!" due to the
 capturing
phase on the parentDiv.
 -The console should not log "Parent Div clicked!" because the bubbling phase should
be stopped by event.stopPropagation().
-On parentDiv Click (not on the button but on the remaining area of the div):
 -The console should log both "Parent Div clicked during capture!" and "Parent Div
clicked!" reflecting the event capturing and bubbling phases respectively.
Learning objective:
Understand and differentiate between event bubbling and event capturing, and 
learn how to control event propagation in the DOM. -->
