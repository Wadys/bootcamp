<!-- 
Instructions:
1. Use the provided HTML structure with a div element.
2. Apply CSS to ensure that when the div is hovered over, its background color 
changes from blue to red. Specifically, configure the transition for the background
color with the following settings:
-Transition Property: Ensure the transition only affects the background color.
-Transition Duration: Set the transition to last exactly 2 seconds.
-Transition Delay: Include a delay of 0.5 seconds before the transition starts.
-Transition Timing Function: Use an 'ease-in-out' timing function to control the 
acceleration curve of the transition.

Learning Objective:
Learn to apply CSS transitions to enhance the interactivity and visual feedback 
of web elements. Students will use transition properties to animate changes in 
a div when it is hovered over. -->
