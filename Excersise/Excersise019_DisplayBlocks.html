Instructions:
1. Use the provided HTML structure which includes three div elements, each with a
unique class.
2. Write all your CSS in the style.css file, which should be linked to your index.html.
3. Style each div based on its class:
-Block Div (block-div):
  -Set the display property to block, which should make the div take up the full
  -width available.
  -Apply a blue background color.
  -Ensure the text color is white.
  -Add padding of 10px all around to increase readability.

-Inline Div (inline-div):
  -Set the display property to inline, allowing the div to sit within the flow of text.
  -Apply a green background color.
  -Ensure the text color is white.
  -Add padding of 10px all around.

  -Inline-Block Div (inline-block-div):
  -Set the display property to inline-block, which allows the div to have a block-like
  behavior but only consume as much width as it needs or is specified.
  -Apply a red background color.
  -Set the width to 50% of its container to demonstrate the block-like properties.
  -Ensure the text color is white.
  -Add padding of 10px all around.
