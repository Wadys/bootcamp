<!--
Instructions:
1. Create Initial Objects: Define two objects:
-person with properties { name: "John", age: 25 }
-job with properties { title: "Developer", company: "Tech Co" }
2. Merge Objects: Use the spread operator to merge person and job into a new object
named employee.
3. Overwrite an Object Property: Overwrite the age property by setting it to 30
in the new employee object during the merge.
4. Add New Property: Add a new property yearStarted with a value of 2020 to the
employee object using the spread operator.
5.Copy Object: Create a copy of the employee object and store it in employeeCopy. 
Then modify employeeCopy by changing the company to "New Tech Co" to demonstrate
that the original employee object remains unchanged.
Important: Write all your code and solutions in index.js. Do not edit the test.js
file. It is used for preview purposes because the JavaScript console is not 
available on Udemy. All your code will be printed to the preview window when you 
run your code.
Learning Objective:
Master the use of the spread operator to manipulate object properties, including
merging, overwriting, and copying objects, enhancing your understanding of object
manipulation in JavaScript. -->
